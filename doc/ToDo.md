I think simple matching based off rom filename would be the easiest. It would be up to the 
individual to make sure his/her media is named appropriately. Most of my artwork comes from 
Emumovies.com and the download utility for that site actually looks at the roms in your 
collection and renames the artwork accordingly. The developer of the frontend for my arcade 
machine (GameEx) designed the utility so that he could make sure his program would be able 
to find all the artwork when a game was launched.
